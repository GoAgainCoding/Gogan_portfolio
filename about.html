    <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello there! My name is Joseph Gogan Jr., but you can call me Joe.</p>
    <p>Upon completing my Bachelor's of Science in Electrical Engineering in May of 2023, 
    I returned to the University at Buffalo for my Master's of Science in Electrical Engineering, 
    graduating in May of 2024. This accelerated time was enabled by the Combined BS/MS program. 
    For my coursework, I have been allowed to focus on a range of topics, 
    adding breadth to my electrical engineering knowledge.</p>
    <p>During the semesters I worked part time as a Digital Signal Processing Engineer at Vocal Technologies, 
    working on projects using various digital signal processing techniques, honing my DSP skills. 
    The small environment allowed me to focus on my individual work skills and habits, 
    while still occasionally working with small teams.</p>
    <p>Outside the lectures, labs and office work, I was the Treasurer for the Society of Hispanic Engineers, 
    and had membership in various other engineering clubs, along with being a musician in multiple clubs and bands. 
    This includes assisting in the organization of DaisyChain's Taco Fest, 
    a charity event in support of the AFSP and Devin Waring Foundation.</p>
    <p>While skilled in Microsoft Excel and Word, Multisim, LTSpice, Matlab, Python, C++, 
    and even intermediate Spanish from education, I've also developed vital customer service, 
    communication, leadership, and teamwork skills through years of grocery store work, 
    a wide range of clubs, and community service opportunities.</p>
    <p>If youâ€™d like to get more in depth with my course work, head to the <a href="courses.html">courses tab</a>.
    <p>And if you care to get to know me better, head to the <a href="contact.html">contact tab</a>.</p>
    <p>Peace and Love,</p>
    <p>Joe</p>
